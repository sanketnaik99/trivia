# Specification Quality Checklist: Trivia App Initial Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✓
- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- No mention of specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches
- All sections written in business language
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness ✓
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 24 functional requirements are clearly stated and testable
- Success criteria include specific, measurable metrics (time, percentage)
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "loads within 2 seconds" vs "React component renders in 2 seconds")
- Each user story has detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions and error scenarios
- Scope is clearly defined through prioritized user stories (P1-P4)
- Key entities and their relationships are documented

### Feature Readiness ✓
- All functional requirements map to user stories and acceptance scenarios
- Four user stories cover authentication, room management, groups, and themes
- Success criteria align with functional requirements and user value
- Specification remains implementation-agnostic throughout

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).
