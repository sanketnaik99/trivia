# Feature Specification: Quizable App Initial Setup

**Feature Branch**: `001-trivia-app-setup`  
**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "initial setup - this application should be a trivia app. It should verify that the user is logged in and if they are then it should take them to the home screen where they have the option to either host or join a 'room'. It should also let them create a 'group' which has a group leaderboard that tracks the results of different trivia sessions. Let's add light and dark theme support to this app"

## User Scenarios & Acceptance Validation *(mandatory)*

**Note**: "Testing" in this section refers to acceptance validation scenarios, not automated test implementation.

### User Story 1 - User Authentication Flow (Priority: P1) **[IN SCOPE]**A user visits Quizable and must log in before accessing any features. If they are already logged in, they are taken directly to the home screen. This ensures only authenticated users can participate in trivia sessions.

**Why this priority**: Authentication is the foundation for all other features. Without it, no user-specific functionality (rooms, groups, leaderboards) can work. This must be delivered first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the app both logged out and logged in, verifying that unauthenticated users see a login screen and authenticated users see the home screen. Delivers value by securing the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is not logged in, **When** they visit the app, **Then** they see a login screen
2. **Given** user is on the login screen, **When** they provide valid credentials, **Then** they are redirected to the home screen
3. **Given** user is already logged in, **When** they visit the app, **Then** they are taken directly to the home screen
4. **Given** user is on the login screen, **When** they provide invalid credentials, **Then** they see an error message and remain on the login screen
5. **Given** user is logged in, **When** they log out, **Then** they are redirected to the login screen

### User Story 2 - Room Management (Priority: P2) **[OUT OF SCOPE - DEFERRED]**

Once authenticated, a user can either host a new trivia room or join an existing room. Hosting creates a new session that others can join, while joining allows participation in an existing session. This enables the core trivia gameplay experience.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary feature for conducting trivia games. While dependent on authentication (P1), it can be independently tested once P1 is complete and delivers the core value proposition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and attempting to host a room (which generates a room code/ID) and join a room (using a valid room code/ID). Delivers value by enabling users to play trivia together.

**Deferred**: Room creation, joining, and real-time presence will be implemented in a future feature iteration.

---

### User Story 3 - Group Creation and Management (Priority: P3) **[OUT OF SCOPE - DEFERRED]**

Users can create groups to organize recurring trivia sessions with the same participants. Each group maintains a persistent leaderboard that tracks results across multiple trivia sessions, allowing for long-term competition tracking.

**Why this priority**: This adds social and competitive features but is not essential for basic trivia gameplay. Can be added after core room functionality works.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a group, adding members, and verifying the group appears in the user's group list. Delivers value by enabling persistent competition tracking.

**Deferred**: Group creation, invitations, and leaderboards will be implemented in a future feature iteration.

---

### User Story 4 - Theme Customization (Priority: P4) **[IN SCOPE]**

Users can toggle between light and dark themes based on their preference. The selected theme persists across sessions and applies to all screens in the application.

**Why this priority**: This is a quality-of-life feature that enhances user experience but is not essential for core functionality. Should be added last.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and toggling between light and dark themes, verifying that all screens reflect the selected theme and that the preference persists after logging out and back in. Delivers value by improving accessibility and user comfort.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is on any screen, **When** they access theme settings, **Then** they can toggle between light and dark modes
2. **Given** user has selected dark mode, **When** they navigate through the app, **Then** all screens display in dark mode
3. **Given** user has selected a theme preference, **When** they log out and log back in, **Then** their theme preference is maintained
4. **Given** user has not selected a preference, **When** they first use the app, **Then** the theme defaults to their system preference (if available) or light mode

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to join a room that has already started or ended?
- How does the system handle when a room host disconnects mid-session?
- What happens when a user is in multiple groups with overlapping members?
- How does the system handle when a user tries to create a group with a duplicate name?
- What happens when network connectivity is lost during a trivia session?
- How does the system handle when a user switches themes during an active trivia session?
- What happens when a group owner tries to delete a group that has active sessions or historical data?
- How does the system handle when a user attempts to join multiple rooms simultaneously?
- What happens when a room reaches maximum capacity and multiple users attempt to join concurrently?

- **Room**: Represents a single trivia session that can be hosted or joined. Key attributes include unique identifier, host user, list of participants, session status (waiting, active, completed), and session start/end time.
	- Identity & Uniqueness: Each room has a globally unique identifier (UUID).
	- Capacity: Each room supports up to 16 participants.

- **Group**: Represents a persistent collection of users who play trivia together. Key attributes include name, owner, member list, creation date, and associated leaderboard. A group can have multiple trivia sessions over time.

- **Leaderboard**: Represents cumulative rankings for a group based on trivia session results. Key attributes include group reference, member rankings, total points/scores, and number of sessions played. Updates after each completed session within the group.
	- Scoring Model: Ranking is based on each member’s total points accumulated across all sessions in the group.
	- Attribute Note: Each member entry maintains a totalPoints value used for ranking.

- **Session**: Represents a completed trivia game within a group context. Key attributes include group reference, participants, scores, completion date, and winner. Multiple sessions contribute to the group leaderboard.
