# Tasks: Quizable Auth + Theme Foundation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-trivia-app-setup/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md

**Tests**: No automated tests required per constitution and feature specification

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Single TanStack Start project at repository root
- Routes: `src/routes/`
- Components: `src/components/`
- Integrations: `src/integrations/`
- Utilities: `src/lib/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and dependency installation

- [ ] T001 Verify package.json has required dependencies (@tanstack/react-start, @tanstack/react-router, @clerk/clerk-react, next-themes, shadcn/ui, tailwindcss)
- [ ] T002 Install missing dependencies if any: npm install
- [ ] T003 [P] Verify or create .env.local with VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY placeholder
- [ ] T004 [P] Verify vite.config.ts is configured for TanStack Start with necessary plugins
- [ ] T005 [P] Verify tailwind.config.ts has theme configuration for light/dark via CSS variables
- [ ] T006 [P] Verify src/styles.css imports Tailwind base, components, utilities and defines CSS vars for colors

**Checkpoint**: Basic project structure and dependencies ready

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T007 Update src/lib/utils.ts to ensure cn() utility exists (for conditional Tailwind classes)
- [ ] T008 Verify or create src/integrations/clerk/provider.tsx with ClerkProvider wrapper
- [ ] T009 Create src/integrations/theme/provider.tsx implementing ThemeProvider from next-themes with class strategy
- [ ] T010 Update src/routes/__root.tsx to wrap app with ClerkProvider and ThemeProvider in correct order
- [ ] T011 [P] Create or verify src/components/ui/ directory exists for shadcn components
- [ ] T012 [P] Verify src/router.tsx is configured with TanStack Router

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - User Authentication Flow (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Implement Clerk-gated authentication so unauthenticated users see login screen and authenticated users land on home screen

**Independent Test**: 
1. Visit app logged out ‚Üí should see Clerk sign-in component
2. Sign in with valid credentials ‚Üí redirected to home screen
3. Visit app already logged in ‚Üí go directly to home screen
4. Sign in with invalid credentials ‚Üí see error, remain on login
5. Click logout ‚Üí redirected to login screen

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create src/routes/sign-in.tsx route with Clerk SignIn component for login page
- [ ] T014 [P] [US1] Create src/routes/sign-up.tsx route with Clerk SignUp component for registration page
- [ ] T015 [US1] Update src/routes/index.tsx to check auth state using useAuth from @clerk/clerk-react
- [ ] T016 [US1] In src/routes/index.tsx redirect unauthenticated users to /sign-in
- [ ] T017 [US1] In src/routes/index.tsx show Home screen content for authenticated users (placeholder: "Welcome to Quizable")
- [ ] T018 [P] [US1] Create src/integrations/clerk/header-user.tsx component with UserButton for logout (already exists, verify it shows user profile and sign out)
- [ ] T019 [US1] Update src/components/Header.tsx to include header-user component when authenticated

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - auth flow works end-to-end

---

## Phase 4: User Story 4 - Theme Customization (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Implement light/dark theme toggle that persists across sessions and applies consistently

**Independent Test**:
1. Access theme toggle ‚Üí can switch between light and dark
2. Select dark mode ‚Üí all screens use dark theme
3. Log out and back in ‚Üí theme preference maintained
4. No preference set on first visit ‚Üí defaults to system preference or light mode

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [ ] T020 [P] [US4] Install shadcn/ui Button and DropdownMenu components: pnpx shadcn@latest add button dropdown-menu
- [ ] T021 [P] [US4] Create src/components/theme-toggle.tsx with theme switcher using next-themes useTheme hook
- [ ] T022 [US4] In theme-toggle.tsx add button with Sun/Moon icons from lucide-react
- [ ] T023 [US4] In theme-toggle.tsx implement dropdown with Light, Dark, System options
- [ ] T024 [US4] Update src/components/Header.tsx to include theme-toggle component
- [ ] T025 [US4] Verify theme provider in src/integrations/theme/provider.tsx has attribute="class" and enableSystem={true}
- [ ] T026 [US4] Verify theme provider has storageKey="quizable-theme" for localStorage persistence
- [ ] T027 [US4] Test theme switching on all existing screens (login, sign-up, home) to ensure consistent styling

**Checkpoint**: Theme customization fully functional - theme persists and applies across all screens

---

## Phase 5: Polish & Integration

**Purpose**: Final touches and cross-story integration

- [ ] T028 [P] Update src/components/Header.tsx with Quizable branding and layout (logo/title, theme toggle, user menu)
- [ ] T029 [P] Verify home screen (src/routes/index.tsx) shows welcoming content for authenticated users
- [ ] T030 Add loading states to sign-in and sign-up routes using Clerk's loading prop
- [ ] T031 [P] Verify all Tailwind theme colors work in both light and dark modes
- [ ] T032 [P] Test full user journey: visit app ‚Üí sign in ‚Üí see home ‚Üí toggle theme ‚Üí log out ‚Üí sign back in ‚Üí theme persists
- [ ] T033 Verify .env.local setup instructions in quickstart.md are accurate
- [ ] T034 Run npm run dev and manually validate all acceptance scenarios from spec.md

**Checkpoint**: Feature complete and ready for demo/deployment

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational (Phase 2) - can proceed in parallel with US1 after Phase 2
- **Polish (Phase 5)**: Depends on US1 and US4 completion

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 (but US1 creates screens to test theme on)

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1**:
- T013 (sign-in route) and T014 (sign-up route) can run in parallel
- T015-T017 (index.tsx updates) must run sequentially
- T018 (header-user component) can run in parallel with T015-T017
- T019 (Header update) depends on T018

**User Story 4**:
- T020 (install components) and T021-T023 (theme-toggle) can overlap
- T024 (add to Header) depends on T021-T023
- T025-T026 (provider config) can run in parallel with T021-T024
- T027 (testing) must run after all others

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Phase 2 tasks T011, T012 can run in parallel
- Once Foundational phase completes:
  - US1 and US4 can be worked on in parallel (by different developers or sequentially)
- Within US1: T013, T014, T018 can all run in parallel
- Within US4: T020, T021-T023, T025-T026 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: After Foundational Phase

```bash
# Two developers can work simultaneously:

Developer A (User Story 1 - Auth):
- Task T013: Create sign-in route
- Task T014: Create sign-up route  
- Task T015-T017: Update index route for auth
- Task T018: Create header-user component
- Task T019: Add to Header

Developer B (User Story 4 - Theme):
- Task T020: Install shadcn components
- Task T021-T023: Create theme-toggle
- Task T024: Add theme-toggle to Header
- Task T025-T027: Configure and test theming
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚úì
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational ‚úì
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 ‚úì
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all auth acceptance scenarios
5. Can deploy just auth if needed (theme comes later)

### Full Feature (Both Stories)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup ‚úì
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational ‚úì
3. Complete Phase 3 AND Phase 4 in parallel (if team capacity) or sequentially (US1 then US4)
4. Complete Phase 5: Polish & Integration
5. Validate all acceptance scenarios for both stories
6. Deploy complete auth + theme foundation

### Incremental Delivery

- After Phase 3: Have working auth-gated app (MVP!)
- After Phase 4: Add theme support (enhancement)
- After Phase 5: Polished, production-ready foundation

---

## Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 34
- **User Story 1 (Auth)**: 7 tasks
- **User Story 4 (Theme)**: 8 tasks
- **Setup + Foundational**: 12 tasks
- **Polish**: 7 tasks
- **Parallel Opportunities**: 15 tasks marked [P]
- **MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 only (auth working)
- **Full Feature**: All phases (auth + theme)

---

## Notes

- No automated tests per constitution - rely on manual acceptance validation
- Each [P] task works on different files and can run in parallel
- [US1] and [US4] labels map tasks to specific user stories for traceability
- Both user stories are independently testable after their respective phases
- Verify Clerk publishable key is set in .env.local before starting Phase 3
- Theme colors should be defined in tailwind.config.ts and src/styles.css
- Commit after each task or logical group for incremental progress
