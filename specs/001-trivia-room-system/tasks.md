# Tasks: Trivia Room System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-trivia-room-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Per project constitution, this project does NOT include testing infrastructure. Quality assurance is performed through code review and manual testing.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Frontend**: Next.js App Router structure at repository root (`app/`, `components/`, `lib/`)
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers in `workers/` directory
- **Configuration**: Root-level config files (`tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `wrangler.toml`)

---

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [x] T014 [P] Create app/lib/utils.ts with cn() utility for className merging
- [x] T015 [P] Create components/ui/ directory and add shadcn/ui components (button.tsx, input.tsx, card.tsx, badge.tsx)
- [x] T016 Create app/lib/types.ts with TypeScript types for Room, Participant, Question, Round, GameState, ConnectionStatus
- [x] T017 Create app/lib/questions.ts with hardcoded array of 10 trivia questions (typed answer format with correctAnswer and acceptedAnswers)
- [x] T018 [P] Create app/lib/websocket.ts with WebSocket client wrapper (connection, reconnection logic, message handlers)
- [x] T019 [P] Create app/lib/room-state.ts with utility functions for room state management and answer normalization
- [x] T020 Create workers/room-durable-object.ts with base Durable Object class structure and WebSocket upgrade handler
- [x] T021 Create workers/types.ts with TypeScript types for WebSocket message protocol (ClientMessage, ServerMessage unions)
- [x] T022 Create app/room/[code]/page.tsx as room page with dynamic route parameter
- [x] T023 [P] Create app/components/loading.tsx with loading spinner component
- [x] T024 [P] Create app/components/error-display.tsx with error message component

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Create/Join): Can start after Phase 2 ‚úÖ
  - US2 (Ready/Start): Depends on US1 (needs lobby) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - US3 (Answer): Depends on US2 (needs game start) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - US4 (Results): Depends on US3 (needs answers) ‚ö†Ô∏è
  - US5 (Continue): Depends on US4 (needs results) ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

**Sequential Flow** (recommended for MVP):
1. **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2** (Foundation) ‚úÖ
2. **Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3** (US1: Create/Join Rooms) ‚úÖ
3. **Phase 3 ‚Üí Phase 4** (US2: Ready Up) - needs lobby from US1
4. **Phase 4 ‚Üí Phase 5** (US3: Answer Questions) - needs game start from US2
5. **Phase 5 ‚Üí Phase 6** (US4: Round Winner) - needs answers from US3
6. **Phase 6 ‚Üí Phase 7** (US5: Continue) - needs results from US4
7. **All stories ‚Üí Phase 8** (Polish)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- All tasks within Phase 1 marked [P] can run in parallel
- All tasks within Phase 2 marked [P] can run in parallel
- Within each user story phase:
  - HTTP API endpoints can be built in parallel
  - UI components marked [P] can be built in parallel
  - Durable Object handlers can be partially parallelized
- Different developers can work on different user stories sequentially once Phase 2 completes

### Within Each User Story

1. **API Endpoints** (parallel) ‚Üí Provides data layer
2. **Durable Object Logic** (sequential) ‚Üí Provides business logic
3. **UI Components** (parallel) ‚Üí Provides presentation layer
4. **Integration** (sequential) ‚Üí Connects everything
5. **Responsive Design** ‚Üí Refinement
6. **Clean Code Review** ‚Üí Final validation

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# After Phase 2 completes, launch all US1 API endpoints in parallel:
T025: "Create app/api/room/create/route.ts"
T026: "Create app/api/room/[code]/route.ts"
T027: "Create app/api/room/[code]/join/route.ts"

# Then build Durable Object logic sequentially:
T028: "Implement room creation logic"
T029: "Implement room validation logic"
# ... etc

# Meanwhile, launch all US1 UI components in parallel:
T035: "Create app/components/create-room-form.tsx"
T036: "Create app/components/join-room-form.tsx"
T037: "Create app/components/room-lobby.tsx"
T038: "Create app/components/participant-card.tsx"
T039: "Create app/components/room-code-display.tsx"

# Finally, integrate everything sequentially:
T040-T049: Integration tasks
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T010)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T011-T024) - **CRITICAL CHECKPOINT**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T025-T049)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: 
   - Create room ‚Üí Get code
   - Join room in different browser ‚Üí See both users
   - Add third user ‚Üí All see updates in real-time
5. Deploy to staging and demo

**Value**: Users can gather in rooms for trivia (foundational social feature)

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. **Setup + Foundational** ‚Üí Foundation ready (T001-T024)
2. **Add US1** ‚Üí Can create/join rooms ‚Üí Deploy MVP ‚úÖ
3. **Add US2** ‚Üí Can ready up and start ‚Üí Deploy v2 üéØ
4. **Add US3** ‚Üí Can answer questions ‚Üí Deploy v3 üéÆ
5. **Add US4** ‚Üí Can see winners ‚Üí Deploy v4 üèÜ
6. **Add US5** ‚Üí Can continue/leave ‚Üí Deploy v5 üîÑ
7. **Polish** ‚Üí Production ready ‚Üí Deploy v1.0 üöÄ

Each deployment adds value without breaking previous features.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers after Phase 2 completes:

**Week 1-2**: All complete Phase 1 + Phase 2 together
**Week 3**: 
- Dev A: Phase 3 (US1) - 25 tasks
- Dev B: Help with US1, prepare for US2
- Dev C: Polish work on Phase 2 components

**Week 4**:
- Dev A: Phase 4 (US2) - 14 tasks
- Dev B: Phase 5 (US3) - 18 tasks (can start if US2 interfaces defined)
- Dev C: Code review and responsive design

**Week 5**:
- Dev A: Phase 6 (US4) - 14 tasks
- Dev B: Phase 7 (US5) - 14 tasks (can start if US4 interfaces defined)
- Dev C: Phase 8 (Polish) - 18 tasks

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 127

**By Phase**:
- Phase 1 (Setup): 10 tasks
- Phase 2 (Foundational): 14 tasks ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKS ALL STORIES
- Phase 3 (US1 - Create/Join): 25 tasks üéØ MVP
- Phase 4 (US2 - Ready/Start): 14 tasks
- Phase 5 (US3 - Answer): 18 tasks
- Phase 6 (US4 - Results): 14 tasks
- Phase 7 (US5 - Continue): 14 tasks
- Phase 8 (Polish): 18 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 47 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phase

**Critical Path**: Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3 ‚Üí Phase 4 ‚Üí Phase 5 ‚Üí Phase 6 ‚Üí Phase 7 ‚Üí Phase 8

**MVP Scope** (Recommended first deployment):
- Phases 1-3 only (49 tasks)
- Delivers: Create/join rooms, see participants in real-time
- Estimated: 1-2 weeks for solo developer, 3-5 days for small team

**Full Feature**:
- All 8 phases (127 tasks)
- Delivers: Complete trivia game with all 5 user stories
- Estimated: 4-6 weeks for solo developer, 2-3 weeks for 3-person team

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies within phase
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently testable via manual validation
- Per constitution: No testing infrastructure - quality assured through code review and manual testing
- Cloudflare Workers and Next.js are separate deployments - can be tested independently
- WebSocket protocol must match between client (app/lib/websocket.ts) and server (workers/room-durable-object.ts)
- All 10 hardcoded questions defined in app/lib/questions.ts with typed answer format
- Answer normalization critical for US4 (lowercase, trim, check acceptedAnswers array)
- Timer synchronization uses server startTime as source of truth (clients calculate locally)
